# Internships-Web-Platform

This project consisted in a web platform to manage internship applications for several company proposals.
There was the company entity, that was responsible to submit any desire for internship and it also could see some information’s related to the candidate, later accepted, by the professor entity. (For example, the classes that aren’t done, or the course average). The student entity could only see the proposals, apply for, evaluate companies and send messages in an embedded chat system.
